# Animated Wallpapers

Automatically change Linux background images with the images in a particular folder using python. So you need python installed to use it. Its just a random script I wrote for myself.

# Installation

Download and install python from https://python.org

## Install Python Packages

```bash
pip install schedule
```

# Usage

## Using the Python File

You can use it directly by running the `changewallpaper.py` or `changewallpaper.pyd` file.

```bash
python changewallpaper.py
```

## Using the Bash Script

You can also use it by running the bash script `run.sh` from the command line.

```bash
source /path/to/animatedwallpapers/run.sh
```

## Adding the script to startup processes

---

# Note

It only works in Linux and you need to have images in the `images/` folder.
It currently works with gnome and cinnamon.
